# mavenlink-auto-location

Save literally dozens of seconds by automatically selecting a location for time entries in Mavenlink.

## Installing Manually

You can install this locally by going to `chrome://extensions/` and enabling developer mode in the upper right corner. This adds a few options below, click "Load unpacked" and choose the "extension" folder of this repo.

## Usage

Click the extension icon, set a default location, then click save.

Notes:
- If you have Mavenlink open, you'll have to refresh the page for your setting to take effect.
- Entering a blank value will disable the functionality.
